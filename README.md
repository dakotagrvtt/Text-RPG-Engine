# RPG-Py
An experimental text-only RPG game engine written in Python.

Using the dice combat and stat rolls system, rather than a boring computer generated random number system, it is easier than ever to create your own custom text-only DnD inspired adventure!

Stories, dialouge and characters are written using [**Yaml**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), a human readable data-serialization language. Creating custom stories is simple and easy and can be done with minimal effort by the game maker.

***As this is simply a prototype, do expect bugs and updates that make more bugs.***
