# Text RPG Engine
An experimental text-only RPG game engine written for browsers.

Using the dice combat and stat rolls system, rather than a boring computer generated random number system, it is easier than ever to create your own custom text-only DnD inspired adventure!

Stories, dialouge and characters are written using [**Yaml**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), a human readable data-serialization language. Creating custom stories is simple and easy and can be done with minimal effort by the game maker.

First create your story. Layout your rules, characters, weapons, factions, etc. first, then upload the game once you're finished.

For now, I only have the concept laid out. Diagrams will be provided once they are fleshed out and finished. Later, mockups for the app will be released.
